m: message
n: indicates name to be displayed in text, it's not necessary for every message because the name remains unless n: is specified again
complete: indicated whether a text node has been completed
complete, isLast: if complete contains this attribute, then the text for this scene (room) will be repeated for the character
checkInventory: generally for when a character requests an item. the player will already have the item and the npc notices. if false, the text node is not completed. it checks the players inventory for a specific item

  if player has item, they will be given option to hand over an object
  if they do not have item, it will end like a normal message
checkState: likely applies to questions, or state specific dialogue. checks wheter the player has fufilled a certain conditino.

"fred": {
  "room": [
      [
      {"m": "Hey.", "n": "Fred"},
      {"m": "Nothing much going on here."},
      {"m": "So.."},
      {"m": "Can you get me fish?", "complete": false}
      ],
      [
      {"m": "Aren't you going? Where's my fish?", "n": "Fred", "complete": "isLast"}

       ]
  ]
},

m: message
n: indicates name to be displayed in text, it's not necessary for every message because the name remains unless n: is specified again
complete: indicated whether a text node has been completed
complete, isLast: if complete contains this attribute, then the text for this scene (room) will be repeated for the character
checkInventory: generally for when a character requests an item. the player will already have the item and the npc notices. if false, the text node is not completed. it checks the players inventory for a specific item
  how it works
  if player has item, they will be given option to hand over an object
  if they do not have item, it will end like a normal message
checkState: likely applies to questions, or state specific dialogue. checks wheter the player has fufilled a certain conditino.

dec 12 2023 note: 
i think i wanna organize diaouge based not on interatables and then their specific location/scene, but the scene, and then the interactables within that scene. Because although a scene will have recurring npcs, it won't always have a random interactable object.

m: message
n: indicates name to be displayed in text, it's not necessary for every message because the name remains unless n: is specified again
complete (single parameter isLast): indicated whether a text node has been completed
complete, isLast: if complete contains this attribute, then the text for this scene (room) will be repeated for the character
checkInventory []: generally for when a character requests an item. the player will already have the item and the npc notices. if false, the text node is not completed. it checks the players inventory for a specific item
  how it works
  if player has item, they will be given option to hand over an object
  if they do not have item, it will end like a normal message
checkState: likely applies to questions, or state specific dialogue. checks wheter the player has fufilled a certain conditino.
removeInventory []: as a message plays, it removes a certain item from the inventory, usually occurs after a checkInventory is true

dec 12 2023 note:
i think i wanna organize diaouge based not on interatables and then their specific location/scene, but the scene, and then the interactables within that scene. Because although a scene will have recurring npcs, it won't always have a random interactable object.

so,
"random-room": {
  "person1": [{"blah blah text blah blah"}, {blah blah}],
  "random duck": [{"ooga booga"}]
}
